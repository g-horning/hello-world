# hello-world
My first repository.

Help me! Help me now!

I want to become a web developer...I think. I am an older worker who just got laid off and I need money...lots and lots of money so I am trying my hand at dabbling with this thing they call 'internet'. 

In any case I am just starting out and it is all so dang confusing.
